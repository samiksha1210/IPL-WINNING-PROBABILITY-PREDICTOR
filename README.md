# IPL-WINNING-PROBABILITY-PREDICTOR
Built a machine learning model using match data (e.g., score, overs, run rate) to predict IPL game outcomes. Applied data cleaning, feature engineering (CRR, RRR), and logistic regression within a pipeline. Achieved performance evaluation via ROC-AUC and confusion matrix, with insights visualized using ROC curves.
